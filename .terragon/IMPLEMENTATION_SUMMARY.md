### 4. Enhanced Pre-commit Integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ Already comprehensive in existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Validated Tools**:
- Code quality: black, isort, flake8, mypy
- Security: bandit, detect-secrets, safety
- C++: clang-format, cmake-format
- Infrastructure: hadolint, yamllint, shellcheck

## üìä Initial Value Discovery Results

**Items Discovered**: 4 high-value opportunities  
**Total Potential Value**: 404.6 composite score points  
**Average Effort**: 4.6 hours per item  
**Value Efficiency Ratio**: 87.9 (score/effort)  

### Top Priority Items Ready for Execution

1. **[SEC-001] Update vulnerable dependencies** - Score: 195.2 üîí
   - Category: Security | Effort: 2h | Priority: HIGH SECURITY
   
2. **[TD-001] Address 32 TODO/FIXME items** - Score: 78.4
   - Category: Technical Debt | Effort: 16h | Priority: MEDIUM
   
3. **[PERF-001] Optimize C++ free energy computation** - Score: 72.1  
   - Category: Performance | Effort: 8h | Priority: MEDIUM
   
4. **[DOC-001] Generate comprehensive API documentation** - Score: 58.9
   - Category: Documentation | Effort: 6h | Priority: LOW

## üéì Continuous Learning Configuration

### Adaptive Scoring Model
- **WSJF Weight**: 0.6 (appropriate for maturing repository focus on business value)
- **Technical Debt Weight**: 0.2 (moderate focus on code quality maintenance)
- **ICE Weight**: 0.1 (lower emphasis on subjective impact assessment)
- **Security Weight**: 0.1 (baseline with 2.0x boost multiplier for security items)

### Discovery Sources Active
- ‚úÖ Git history analysis (TODO/FIXME/HACK detection)
- ‚úÖ Static analysis integration (MyPy, Flake8, Bandit)
- ‚úÖ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Performance hot-spot identification
- üîÑ GitHub issue integration (requires API setup)
- üîÑ Production monitoring integration (requires APM setup)

## üîÑ Execution Readiness Status

### Autonomous Capabilities
- **Discovery Engine**: ‚úÖ Fully operational
- **Scoring System**: ‚úÖ Calibrated for repository maturity
- **Priority Queue**: ‚úÖ 4 items ready for execution
- **Safety Validations**: ‚úÖ Test, build, security checks configured
- **Rollback Procedures**: ‚úÖ Documented and implemented

### Manual Oversight Required
- **First Execution**: Requires approval for baseline establishment
- **Security Items**: Manual review for dependency updates
- **Breaking Changes**: Human review for architectural modifications
