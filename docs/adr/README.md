# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Active Inference Sim Lab project.

## Format

We use the following template for ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision and how it solves the problem]

## Consequences
### Positive
[List positive outcomes]

### Negative
[List negative outcomes or trade-offs]

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternative solutions considered]

## Implementation Notes
[Any implementation-specific details]

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

## Index

- [ADR-0001](0001-use-hybrid-cpp-python-architecture.md): Use Hybrid C++/Python Architecture

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template above
2. Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
3. Use descriptive, action-oriented titles
4. Include date of decision
5. Update this index
