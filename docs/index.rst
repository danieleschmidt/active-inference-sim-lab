What is Active Inference?
-------------------------

Active inference is a theoretical framework that describes how biological and artificial
agents can minimize surprise (or free energy) through perception and action. Unlike
traditional reinforcement learning approaches, active inference agents:

* **Model uncertainty explicitly** through probabilistic generative models
* **Balance exploration and exploitation** naturally through free energy minimization
* **Unify perception and action** under a single mathematical framework
* **Achieve sample efficiency** by leveraging strong inductive biases

Key Features
------------

ðŸš€ **Fast C++ Core**
   Optimized implementation of active inference algorithms for maximum performance

ðŸ§  **Free Energy Minimization**
   Principled approach to perception and action based on the Free Energy Principle

ðŸ“Š **Belief-Based Planning**
   Agents that model uncertainty explicitly and plan accordingly

ðŸŽ® **Environment Integration**
   Built-in support for Gym, MuJoCo, and custom environments

âš¡ **AXIOM Compatibility**
   Reproduce published results achieving human-level performance with minimal data

ðŸ’¾ **Minimal Dependencies**
   Runs on edge devices with less than 100MB memory footprint

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from active_inference import ActiveInferenceAgent, FreeEnergyObjective

   # Create agent with generative model
   agent = ActiveInferenceAgent(
       state_dim=4,
       obs_dim=8,
       action_dim=2,
       inference_method="variational"
   )

   # Define free energy objective
   objective = FreeEnergyObjective(
       complexity_weight=1.0,
       accuracy_weight=1.0
   )

   # Run inference loop
   obs = env.reset()
   for step in range(1000):
       # Perception: Infer hidden states
       beliefs = agent.infer_states(obs)
       
       # Action: Minimize expected free energy
       action = agent.plan_action(beliefs, horizon=5)
       
       # Execute and observe
       obs, reward = env.step(action)
       
       # Update generative model
       agent.update_model(obs, action)
