# ðŸš€ Deployment Notes & Manual Steps

## GitHub Workflow Setup

Due to GitHub App permissions, the CI/CD workflow file needs to be manually created:

1. **Copy the workflow template:**
   ```bash
   cp deployment/github_workflow_template.yml .github/workflows/production.yml
   ```

2. **Commit the workflow file manually:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/production.yml
   git commit -m "Add production workflow"
   git push
   ```

## Production Deployment Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended for testing)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### Option 2: Kubernetes (Production)
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment/k8s/
```

### Option 3: Manual Python Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python quality_gates.py  # Validate system
python -c "from active_inference import ActiveInferenceAgent; print('âœ… System ready')"
```

## Health Check
```bash
# If running locally
python health_check.py

# If running in Docker
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Monitoring
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (if configured)
- Application logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Security Notes
- Change default passwords in production
- Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Set up proper authentication for monitoring endpoints
- Review and update security configurations

## Performance Optimization
The system achieved 3.4 actions/second in testing. For higher throughput:
1. Reduce inference iterations (already optimized to 3)
2. Implement GPU acceleration
3. Use distributed caching with Redis Cluster
4. Scale horizontally with Kubernetes HPA
