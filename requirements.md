# Requirements Document
## Active Inference Simulation Lab

### Problem Statement
Current reinforcement learning approaches require massive amounts of data and lack principled uncertainty handling. Active inference offers a biologically-inspired alternative that can achieve human-level performance with orders of magnitude less data by modeling uncertainty explicitly.

### Success Criteria
- Achieve 10x sample efficiency compared to PPO on Atari games
- Support both C++ and Python interfaces for performance and accessibility
- Memory footprint under 100MB for edge device deployment
- Match AXIOM paper results (3-minute Pong mastery)
- Support hierarchical and multi-modal perception

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Core active inference algorithms (variational, particle, Kalman filtering)
- Free energy minimization and expected free energy computation
- Gym environment integration and MuJoCo physics support
- Python bindings for C++ core implementation
- Visualization and analysis tools

**Out of Scope:**
- Full neural network implementations (focus on principled models)
- Production deployment infrastructure
- Real-time robotics control systems
- Commercial licensing and support
